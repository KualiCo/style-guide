Kuali.co Style Guide
====================

This repository lets us create css styles (and possibly components) that give our components nice defaults. 

What belongs here
-----------------

This should work like Foundation. It has classes to give our components a nice out-of-the-box look. Examples:

- the company logo
- consistent dropdowns
- consistent header bar
- typeahead search box styles (but not the component)

What doesn't belong here
------------------------

Complicated component behavior should probably be published as open source. Think about what parts to publish so another company could use the component and publish those. Examples:

- typeahead search box (but not the styles)
